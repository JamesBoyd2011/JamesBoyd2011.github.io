        <p>From the initial design and installation of your organizations network infrastructure to future upgrades and
          changes to the network, making the decision to install new wiring versus using existing outdated wiring will
          make the difference on how fast and reliable your systems will operate. </p>

        <p> We will design and install your network infrastructure to meet the needs of your business.</p>

        <p> Your system will be installed using CAT5e or CAT6. Our technicians will also label and test all your LAN
          port and patch panel connections. Properly labeling your network will aid in the future auditing and
          identification of existing cabling for future troubleshooting and restructuring of your network. </p>

      <p>In a multi dwelling family unit, the telephone company is responsible for bringing the dial tone for the
        residents phone service up to what is known as the DMARC or Demarcation. The DMARC is the telephone company’s
        main telephone terminal that may be in the same building as the customer or in adjacent buildings.


        From this point, the customer is responsible for hiring another company to extend their telephone service into
        the customers apartment/condo. When the telephone service is extended from the DMARC, the distribution wiring
        also called house cabling which is owned by the Apartment/Condo is utilized to complete the wiring of the phone
        service. In some cases the wiring is very old, damaged or is otherwise not adequate to support the functionality
        of the telephone line.


        That’s where we come in. Our company can evaluate your existing distribution wiring infrastructure and provide
        you with a comprehensive, cost effective method to repair or replace the damaged areas of the telephone
        distribution wiring on your property.

      </p>
